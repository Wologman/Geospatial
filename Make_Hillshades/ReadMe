Likely to need updating for Windows.  Currently only tested on Ubuntu.

If all these are placed in the same directory as your QGS project file, then running the Main_Script.py  will open any DEM rasters you choose, 
or lets you chose one that is already open, and turns it into a nice looking hillshade, with a transparent tinting layer over a hillshade layer, 
bundled together into a group.

Currently intended for a projected co-ordinate system.  If the source data is in WGS-84, it will be re-projected into NZGD2000.  If this funtction was 
removed, and the hillshade is made in WGS-84 then it is necessary to adjust the scale parameter (the ratio of vertical units to horizontal).
